# Kinda Modern Beta
Kinda Modern Beta is a modpack for the [Modern Beta](https://modernbeta.org/) server, trying to be the best possible experience for playing on the server. Check out the features:

## Features
- Pre-configured Nostalgia Tweaks for beta lighting, beta menus, and a lot more
- A custom beta-esque main menu with a button to log straight into the server
- Tons of optimization, letting even toasters and potatoes enjoy Modern Beta
- Includes Server Pack Unlocker, allowing the use of custom resource packs
- Everything required for the official server pack to work as intended, including the beta sky & stars
- Numbered ping, like the server used to have :)
- Every proxy pre-loaded into the server list
- The server pack is pre-installed, allowing for stuff like menus and tooltips and such to be consistent across the server and singleplayer

And a whole bunch of other stuff not important enough to list here! If you have issues or just want to discuss the pack, it has a dedicated forum post in the Modern Beta Discord, linked on this page's sidebar.

Thanks to [Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop), on which this pack was (vaguely) built upon, and to everyone who developed the Modern Beta server and [texture pack](https://github.com/ModernBetaNetwork/ResourcePacks/releases/tag/Release)
