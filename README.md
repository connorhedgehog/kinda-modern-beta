# Kinda Modern Beta
Kinda Modern Beta is a modpack for the [Modern Beta](https://modernbeta.org/) server, aiming to make the server feel less modern and more beta, while providing a few tweaks and QOL features along the way.

## Features
- Pre-configured Nostalgia Tweaks for everything beta, whether it's lighting, menus, or anything else
- A custom beta-esque main menu with a button to log straight into the server
- Tons of optimization, letting everyone experience Modern Beta!
- Includes Server Pack Unlocker, allowing the use of custom resource packs
- Everything required for the official server pack to work as intended, including the beta sky & stars
- Numbered ping, like the server used to have :)
- Every proxy pre-loaded into the server list for easy access
- Server pack pre-installed, allowing for things like tooltips to be consistent across the server and singleplayer
- Highly configured JourneyMap, made to feel like an old Beta mod
- Built in zoom mod

And a whole bunch of other little stuff! If you have issues or just want to discuss the pack, it has a dedicated forum post in the Modern Beta Discord, linked on this page's sidebar.

Thanks to [Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop), on which this pack was (vaguely) built upon, and to everyone on the dev team for Modern Beta server its and [texture pack](https://github.com/ModernBetaNetwork/ResourcePacks/releases/tag/Release).
